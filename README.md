# Self Leveling Quadcopter
As you can tell by the title this project is a self leveling quadcopter that I built using an Arduino Uno. This project is just something that I wanted to try to build for fun and to see if I could make a semi functional drone that has a functional self leveling feature. I have writen 2 versions of the code Manual and SelfLevel. Manual you use the joystick to change the amount of power going to each motor. Self Level you use the joystick to change the tilt angle and the arduino does all the leveling for you.

Sorry for the mess of Electrical Tape I ran out of Plexi Glass and Screws. Also the frame cracked so I put Electrical Tape over the screws for the motors just in case.
